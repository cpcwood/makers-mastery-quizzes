# Write a program that lists the names of people who all like a
# specific thing. It should:
# * Ask the user to input a category - `sport` or `fruit`.
# * Ask the user to input a category value e.g. `kiwi`.
# * `puts` the names of each of the people who like the thing in the
#   category, one per line.
#
# * Example output:
#   ```
#   Enter what category to search
#   sport
#   Enter what value to search for
#   squash
#   Mary
#   Lauren
#   Govind
#   ```
#
# Note: You can assume that, when asked for a category, the user will
# only enter either `sport` or `fruit`.  The user might enter a
# category value that no person has (e.g. `mango`).
